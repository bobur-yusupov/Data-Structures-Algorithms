# String

**String** - sequence of characters stored in contiguous memory.

```
char word[] = "Hello, World";
```

In the example above `word` is an array of `char` elements. In **C++** this contigues memory will be terminated with `\0`.

We also can get access to a specific element by its index. For example we can get access to `e` using its index `word[1]`. 

In **C** or **C++** string is not a built-in data type. We can use `string.h` to get benefit of string. But in **Python** we have `str` data type for `string`.
